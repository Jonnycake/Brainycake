(0) holds half height
(1) holds design character
(2) holds fill character
(3) holds newline
(4) holds number of spaces
(5) holds number of rows
(6) holds number of design characters
(7) used as temporary variable to copy values back and forward
(8) used as secondary temporary variable to keep half height around after top of diamond
